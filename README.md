**Before we start providing you with resources**..    
## :cyclone: What about android as operating system(OS): 

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/android2.jpeg" width="650" >
</p> 

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software.   
**Designed for:**   
  
- Smartphones & Tablets :iphone:
- Tv :tv:
- Wear OS :watch:
- Android things :crystal_ball:

`First of all we should learn a programming language from [java or Kotlin] and XML [for building the user interface(UI)]`

## I recommend you to start with java as a programming language.. why? :sweat_smile:

- Most of open source was written with java.
- Most of apps built with java and if you worked somewhere at a company, how do you refactor this app that built with java!
- There are much more Java tutorials and almost every solution for Android problems on pages like Stack Overflow from the last years have been written in Java. 

**`Don't worry Java is not going to be obsolete` :muscle:**  

## Learn java: (Due to 3 or 4 weeks)

2. Java OOP
// TODO add a good resource here.

-->
### Before moving to the next level be sure that you have a good knowledge about:   
- OOP.
- Looping (for - while - doWhile).
- Make a decision (if else - switch).
- Exception handling (try catch).
- Casting, static, final, generics.
- Using interface and abstraction and Anonynmous object.
- :point_right: **Build a simple project with java like ( Banking or Hotel or SuperMarket system)**.

`Now you are ready to start with android`

## Basic level:
Now you are ready to build user interface using xml and write some java code at android studio. 
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/ui.png" width="650">

3. Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps​ ​ (due to 1 Month)   
https://mena.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839   

After you have learned to use Relative and Linear layout.. there is another amazing thing called **Constraint layout** to build a responsive layout   
[check this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N4bCdyGcUc&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuA80lNWNCLICR3qYzhw3iPI)   

**`Go a head and build a project and use the tools that you learned in basic level`**

### After that you are ready to work with database and networking so..   

### Database in android:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/rdatabase.png" width="450">
</p>   
In android world.. the database commes from different sources (Local & Remote).   

**Local:** We use shared preference and room database(based on sqllite).

**Remote:** We can use firebase or some thing called API.

**:point_right: `Don't Worry right now about that, we 'll provide you with useful resources to learn that`**

## Intermediate part 1: 
Before that you should learn an important view called recycle view.. Why?    
Most of android apps need to display a list of any type of data for users so the best way to handle that using recycler view.
